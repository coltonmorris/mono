# Credentials

[https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?authuser=0&project=supple-coral-207005](Here for credentials, probably need to use web client.)

Should look into using the drive api for a web server to load the files. 

## TODO

1. Remove that project I made up there ^
2. Use google cold storage to store photos, videos, and music into corresponding buckets
  + Use golang + gazelle
